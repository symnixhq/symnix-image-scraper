  This repository contains a Python3 script which we use internally as a microservice to get the latest image versions of a Docker image as a human readable version from <a href="https://hub.docker.com/"><b>Docker Hub</b></a>.
</p>
<br />

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Usage

1. Make sure you've installed Docker including `docker compose` support on your target system.
   You can install `docker compose` following this instruction: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

<br>


## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

One of the most important features we are planning to implement is an API interface to use the output
from the microservice in your application instead of the JSON file.
